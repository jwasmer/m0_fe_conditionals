# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

I feel relatively confident in my understand and fluency of them. I think more repetition would definitely help, but I didn't feel like I ran into any major struggles during the assignment.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

I feel relatively confident in my understanding and fluency. I think these make the most sense to me since it's not a concept exclusive to coding.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

I feel cautiously optimistic that I have a good understanding of these and can use them comfortably.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

This lesson took most of the day. There's a lot of work packed in here, and the sheer volume of it ended up taking me much longer than I budgeted for.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I never really think to use comparisons, so I think practicing those will be helpful just to expand my toolset.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I don't have many questions on this topic. The code challenges were a fun exercise though, I like the idea of programming live. It adds a little bit more stress.
